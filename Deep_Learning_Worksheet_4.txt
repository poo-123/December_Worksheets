Q11 to Q15 are subjective answer type question. Answer them briefly.

11. Describe the basic architecture of a CNN?

ANS:
A CNN architecture is formed by a stack of distinct layers that transform the input volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores) through a differentiable function.
 A few distinct types of layers are commonly used. CNN architecture is inspired by the organization and functionality of the visual cortex and designed to mimic the connectivity pattern of neurons within the human brain.
 The neurons within a CNN are split into a three-dimensional structure, with each set of neurons analyzing a small region or feature of the image.

12. What is convolution in CNN? What is the role of convolution in image processing?

ANS: The term convolution refers to the mathematical combination of two functions to produce a third function. It merges two sets of information. In the case of a CNN, the convolution is performed on the input data with the use of a filter or kernel (these terms are used interchangeably) to then produce a feature map.
Convolution is the process of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel. This is related to a form of mathematical convolution. The matrix operation being performed—convolution—is not traditional matrix multiplication, despite being similarly denoted by *.

13. What is the difference between Max Pooling and Average Pooling? Explain briefly.

ANS: Average pooling method smooths out the image and hence the sharp features may not be identified when this pooling method is used. Max pooling selects the brighter pixels from the image. It is useful when the background of the image is dark and we are interested in only the lighter pixels of the image.
Average pooling involves calculating the average for each patch of the feature map. This means that each 2×2 square of the feature map is down sampled to the average value in the square.
Max pooling is a sample-based discretization process. The objective is to down-sample an input representation (image, hidden-layer output matrix, etc.), reducing its dimensionality and allowing for assumptions to be made about features contained in the sub-regions binned.

14. What is Padding? Why is it used?

ANS: Padding is the space that's inside the element between the element and the border. Padding goes around all four sides of the content and we can target and change the padding for each side (just like a margin).
The padding property in CSS defines the innermost portion of the box model, creating space around an element's content, inside of any defined margins and/or borders. Padding values are set using lengths or percentages, and cannot accept negative values. The initial, or default, value for all padding properties is 0 .

15. Describe the layers used in classification part of a CNN?
ANS:
There are three types of layers in a convolutional neural network: convolutional layer, pooling layer, and fully connected layer. Each of these layers has different parameters that can be optimized and performs a different task on the input data.
